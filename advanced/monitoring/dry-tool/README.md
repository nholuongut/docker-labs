#  Manage and Monitor Your Docker Containers with Dry Tool in 5 Min

If you are looking out for a tool which can manage Docker & Docker Swarm, you really need to try out "Dry" tool. With close to 1500 stars in short span of time, this tool is a terminal application to manage both Docker Host & Docker Swarm Mode.It shows information about Containers, Images and Networks, and, if running a Swarm cluster, it shows information about Nodes, Service, Stacks and the rest of Swarm constructs. It can be used with both local or remote Docker daemons.

Besides showing information, it can be used to manage Docker. Most of the commands that the official Docker CLI provides, are available in dry with the same behaviour. also, it can also be used as a monitoring tool for Docker containers.Dry can be installed as a single binary and does not require external libraries.

Under this tutorial, I will show you how to get started with this tool to manage and monitor your Docker containers

## Tested Infrastructure

<table class="tg">
  <tr>
    <th class="tg-yw4l"><b>Platform</b></th>
    <th class="tg-yw4l"><b>Number of Instance</b></th>
    <th class="tg-yw4l"><b>Reading Time</b></th>
    
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td class="tg-yw4l"><b> Play with Docker</b></td>
    <td class="tg-yw4l"><b>1</b></td>
    <td class="tg-yw4l"><b>5 min</b></td>
    
  </tr>
  
</table>

## Pre-requisite

- Create an account with [DockerHub](https://hub.docker.com)
- Open [PWD](https://labs.play-with-docker.com/) Platform on your browser 
- Click on **Add New Instance** on the left side of the screen to bring up Alpine OS instance on the right side

## Running Multiple containers in an interactive and detached mode.

## Verifying if containers are Up and Running: 

```
$ docker ps

```
## Verifying the exited containers

```
$ docker ps -a
```

## Observe the below results:

```
[node1] (local) root@192.168.0.33 ~
$ docker ps
CONTAINER ID        IMAGE               COMMAND             CREATED             STATUS      PORTS               NAMES

## Interacting with Docker Containers:

Use the navigation keys mentioned below to interact with the terminal.

```
[H]:Help [Q]:Quit | [F1]:Sort [F2]:Toggle Show Containers [F5]:Refresh [%]:Filter |
[m]:Monitor mode [2]:Images [3]:Networks [4]:Nodes [5]:Services | [Enter]:Commands 

```

### Select any container from the list and hit [enter] to open the options:

```
Fetch logs
Inspect container
Kill container
Remove container
Restart
Show image history
Stats + Top
Stop

```
## Verifying the Results

## 2.Interacting with Docker images:

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nholuongut/Docker-Containers-with-Dry-Tool/master/Picture1.png)

 - Press [2] to switch to Docker images. It will show a list of your Docker images.
 - Select any image from the list and hit [enter] to show the details of the selected image.

You can use the shortcuts in Dry:<br>
“Ctrl + D” to remove dangling. It is equivalent to docker volume rm with the flag dangling=true <br>
“Ctrl + E” to remove image. It is equivalent to docker rmi. <br>
“CTRL + F” to force remove. It is equivalent to docker rmi --force <br>

## 3.Interacting with Docker Networks:

- Press [3] to switch to Docker networks. It will show a list of your active Docker networks. 
- Select any network from the list and hit [enter] to fetch and show the details of the selected network. The output will look similar to the below:
